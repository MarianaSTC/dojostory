This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for make-up, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go

Lucky quickly brushes her hair and puts on her favorite dress. 
She knows today is a special day, filled with possibilities. 
As she steps outside, the sun kisses her cheeks, and a gentle breeze whispers promises of adventure. 
With a skip in her step, Lucky sets off, her heart brimming with excitement. 
Little does she know, the day holds surprises that will change her life forever.

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night? (Oh)
Whoa
Best actress, and the winner is Lucky (whoa)
(I, I, yeah, oh) Whoa
I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News
Standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky
Oh my God here she comes
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
