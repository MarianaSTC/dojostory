This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for make-up, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go

Lucky quickly brushes her hair and puts on her favorite dress. 
She knows today is a special day, filled with possibilities. 
As she steps outside, the sun kisses her cheeks, and a gentle breeze whispers promises of adventure. 
With a skip in her step, Lucky sets off, her heart brimming with excitement. 
Little does she know, the day holds surprises that will change her life forever.
